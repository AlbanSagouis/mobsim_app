# **mobsim_app** -- Simulation and visualization of biodiversity patterns across spatial scales using the `mobsim` R-package 

## Authors

## Description

This is an interactive tool that aims to simulate and visualize multiple biodiversity patterns across spatial scales using the `mobsim` R-package. A **Thomas model** is used to simulate point pattern distributions of individual species. Key parameters of the simulation are:

* **total number of individuals**, 
* **total number of species**, 
* the coefficient of variation in the species-abundance distribution that determines the **eveness of the abundances**,
* **spatial aggregation of species**.

The tool   
1. simulates locations of individuals of different species in a location (plot, area);      
2. plots biodiversity patterns such as   
+ species-abundance distributions (SAD) using Preston octave plot and rank-abundance curve,   
+ spatial distribution of individuals within a unit area,  
+ species accummulation curves (SAC), species-area relationships (SAR), and the distance-decay curve.   

## Run the app on the web

The app is hosted at the following url: https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobsim_app

## Run the app locally

The app can be run locally. Several R packages are required for locally hosting the app, these can be installed
from the R terminal:

```r
install.packages(c('shiny', 'shinyBS', 'devtools'))
library(devtools)
install_github('mobiodiv/mobsim')
```

Once those dependencies are installed you can run the app from the R terminal using:

```r
library(shiny)  
runGitHub("mobiodiv/mobsim_app")
```
